    <p>After my graduation from the university my interest in <span class="web">computer programming</span> grew bigger but i had to go for the complusary National youth service corp (NYSC) you may want to check it out <a href="http://www.nysc.org.ng/">here</a> to no what it is about but it is complusary for every Nigerian citizen home and abroad to to through the program for a period of one year, this program was introduced by Genaral YAKUBU GOWAN a then miliatry head of state to forstall unit with the different earthinic groups in Nigeria after the civil war.</p><br>At my place of primary assignment during the NYSC program in DAMATURU yobe state, i met some of my collegue who were computer programmers and were intrested in teaching me ,unfortunatly for me i had no computer of my own that was a hidderance because after the class i wouild have to practice on my own for better understanding and since i had no computer it was outrightly impossible.
