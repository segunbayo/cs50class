<h1 id="big"> MY EXPERIENCE WITH CS50 </h1>
    <div id="power">
    <p>Sometimes in May 2019, i stumbled ona site were i saw briefly <span class="web">Web progamming</span> i went through the material carefully and discorvered it was a course offered by <span class="web">
     Harvard university</span>i got attracted by the simple fact that it had to do with programming. i immediatly decieded i was going to register for the course which i eventually did, after registering i discorvered cs50 was an advanced on web design which i had learnt long ago but stop along the waybut this time i most complete it.</p> <p>CS50 has been fun and intresting,thou, i'm just starting, it has been intresting and i'm glad i signup for it. Most intrested</p>
       is the commmand, i never thougth i coould understand but i deed, i was difficult for me  at first, i had to make calls, ask questions, search google even watched some clips on youtube just to understand command prompt on windows, thank God my efforts paid off and like we say <em>success is the reward for hardwork.</em></p><p>At this point i can boldly say there are steps in life towards archieveing onces goals;
         <ul>
         <li>set your goals</li>
         <li>be determined to archieve your goals</li>
         <li>go agianst all odds to getting your goals</li>
         <li>you will be their some day</li>
       </ul>
