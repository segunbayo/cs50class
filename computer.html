  <div id="Body1">
  <p>My love for <span class="web">computer programming</span> started in my second year at the university of ilorin. I had this roommate <strong>AYOBAMI</strong> we call him <q>A.Y</q> ,  A.Y was a computer genious, he was a good programmer and was also good in computer engineering, he was actually a computer science student who was in his second year as well. A.Y was different from every regular computer science student in school for his knowledge at his level, at 200Level which is his second year in school, he was writting programs for students in their final year for thier projects</p>
  <p>A.Y computer system in our room was my first closeness to any PC, i enjoyed watching him when he works and every thing he did was spectacular. i had never touched a mouse before infat i had no knowledge how ever minute. As a cMathematics student i offer some computer courses too but i had no practical experience.</p><p>One spectaculer thing about A.Y was yhe antivirus he installed, it makes this screaming noise when ever it attacks a virus from any external device attached to it.</p>
  <p>I watched Ayo write computer programs alot and the steps were intresting so one day i called him and asked if he could teach me how to write computer programs which he oblaged to but then i has some personal assignment <em>i.e</em> first i have to get conversant with the parts of the computer like;
    <ul>
    <li>Keyboard</li>
    <li>Mouse</li>
    <li>Desktop</li>
    <li>CPU</li>
    <li>USB. e.t.c </li>
  </ul> since it was a desktop PC then get used with some of the terminologies of computer science, i also needed to learn how to type according to him <q>it was as important as te programmingit self.</q> so when ever he was'nt using the computer i will practice typing with the Marvin beacon software</p><p>After our 200Level we got emoved to different rooms aand so my hoe of learning computer programming was dashed becuase movement from one hustel to another in school became restricted and so it became imposible to reach AYOBAMI.</p> <p>Back in the university i also did some computer science course where we did some introducction to computer and some algorism some of those courses include
    <ol>
      <li>csc101</li>
      <li>csc102</li>
        <ul>
          <li>introduction to computer science.</li>
          <li>Component of a computer.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>csc201</li>
      <li>csc202</li>
    </ol> The major challengies was that we were mainly thought theoryand no practical so understanding practicing what we have being thought was a challenge.</p>
